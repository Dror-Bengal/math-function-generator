# Linear Function Improvement Plan

## Progress Tracker
ðŸŸ¢ = Completed
ðŸŸ¡ = In Progress
âšª = Not Started

## Phase 1: Basic Graph Improvements
### Step 1.1: Axis Labeling âœ… ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Add clear x and y axis labels to all graphs
- [x] Test: Verify that all generated graphs show labeled axes
- [x] Expected output: Every graph shows "x" and "y" labels
- [x] Status: Completed with enhanced styling and RTL support

### Step 1.2: Intersection Points Consolidation âœ… ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Modify questions to combine x and y intersection points
- [x] Remove separate y-intercept question
- [x] Test: Generate questions and verify the new format
- [x] Expected output: Single question about all intersection points
- [x] Status: Completed with unified intersection points display

## Phase 2: Function Analysis ðŸŸ¡
### Step 2.1: Function Sign Analysis âœ… ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Add questions about positive/negative intervals
- [x] Add visual indicators for positive/negative regions
- [x] Add hover text showing exact intervals
- [x] Test: Generate questions and verify they include sign analysis
- [x] Expected output: Questions should ask where f(x) > 0 and f(x) < 0
- [x] Status: Completed with enhanced visualization and hover text
- [x] Added: Improved point formatting and removed duplicate labels
- [x] Added: RTL support for interval display
- [x] Added: Mobile touch support for better interaction

### Step 2.2: Question Cleanup ðŸŸ¡
- [ ] Remove questions about extreme points, edge behavior, etc.
- [ ] Test: Verify removed questions don't appear
- [ ] Expected output: Simpler, more focused question set
- [ ] Status: Started planning the cleanup

## Phase 3: Graph Drawing Questions âšª
### Step 3.1: Graph-First Questions
- [ ] Implement questions that show graph immediately
- [ ] Test: Generate these questions and verify graph visibility
- [ ] Expected output: Questions with graphs visible from start

### Step 3.2: Sketch-First Questions
- [ ] Add questions requiring initial sketching
- [ ] Include answer graphs for verification
- [ ] Test: Generate these questions and verify format
- [ ] Expected output: Questions without initial graphs but with solution graphs

## Phase 4: Two-Function Analysis âšª
### Step 4.1: Basic Two-Function Setup
- [ ] Implement ability to generate and display two functions
- [ ] Test: Generate two-function questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions showing two functions simultaneously

### Step 4.2: Two-Function Questions
- [ ] Add intersection point questions
- [ ] Add inequality questions (f(x) > g(x))
- [ ] Test: Generate these comparison questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions about function relationships

### Step 4.3: Area Analysis
- [ ] Add questions about areas between functions
- [ ] Test: Generate area-related questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions about regions between functions

## Recent Progress Summary:
1. Completed axis labeling with enhanced styling and RTL support
2. Completed intersection points consolidation
3. Completed function sign analysis with visual indicators
4. Enhanced hover text with proper RTL formatting and point display
5. Removed duplicate point labels and improved visualization
6. Added mobile touch support for better interaction
7. Improved code organization and reduced duplication

## Next Steps:
1. Continue work on question cleanup (Phase 2.2)
   - Review current question templates
   - Remove unnecessary complexity
   - Focus on core linear function concepts
2. Plan implementation of Graph Drawing Questions (Phase 3)
3. Begin designing Two-Function Analysis features (Phase 4)

## Notes:
- All changes should maintain RTL support
- Keep performance in mind when adding new features
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Keep code modular and reusable
- Ensure mobile-friendly interaction
