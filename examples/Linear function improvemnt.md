# Linear Function Improvement Plan

## Progress Tracker
ðŸŸ¢ = Completed
ðŸŸ¡ = In Progress
âšª = Not Started

## Phase 1: Basic Graph Improvements
### Step 1.1: Axis Labeling âœ… ðŸŸ¢
- [x] Add clear x and y axis labels to all graphs
- [x] Test: Verify that all generated graphs show labeled axes
- [x] Expected output: Every graph shows "x" and "y" labels
- [x] Status: Completed with enhanced styling and RTL support

### Step 1.2: Intersection Points Consolidation ðŸŸ¡
- [x] Modify questions to combine x and y intersection points
- [x] Remove separate y-intercept question
- [x] Test: Generate questions and verify the new format
- [ ] Expected output: Single question about all intersection points
- Status: Partially completed, need to verify in all function types

## Phase 2: Function Analysis âšª
### Step 2.1: Function Sign Analysis
- [ ] Add questions about positive/negative intervals
- [ ] Test: Generate questions and verify they include sign analysis
- [ ] Expected output: Questions should ask where f(x) > 0 and f(x) < 0

### Step 2.2: Question Cleanup
- [ ] Remove questions about extreme points, edge behavior, etc.
- [ ] Test: Verify removed questions don't appear
- [ ] Expected output: Simpler, more focused question set

## Phase 3: Graph Drawing Questions âšª
### Step 3.1: Graph-First Questions
- [ ] Implement questions that show graph immediately
- [ ] Test: Generate these questions and verify graph visibility
- [ ] Expected output: Questions with graphs visible from start

### Step 3.2: Sketch-First Questions
- [ ] Add questions requiring initial sketching
- [ ] Include answer graphs for verification
- [ ] Test: Generate these questions and verify format
- [ ] Expected output: Questions without initial graphs but with solution graphs

## Phase 4: Two-Function Analysis âšª
### Step 4.1: Basic Two-Function Setup
- [ ] Implement ability to generate and display two functions
- [ ] Test: Generate two-function questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions showing two functions simultaneously

### Step 4.2: Two-Function Questions
- [ ] Add intersection point questions
- [ ] Add inequality questions (f(x) > g(x))
- [ ] Test: Generate these comparison questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions about function relationships

### Step 4.3: Area Analysis
- [ ] Add questions about areas between functions
- [ ] Test: Generate area-related questions
- [ ] Expected output: Questions about regions between functions

## Recent Progress Summary:
1. Completed axis labeling with enhanced styling and RTL support
2. Improved graph visualization with better grid lines and axis formatting
3. Started work on intersection points consolidation
4. Updated FunctionTypes to support new characteristics
5. Enhanced GraphVisualizer to handle different point types

## Next Steps:
1. Complete the intersection points consolidation testing
2. Begin work on function sign analysis
3. Update question templates to reflect new analysis requirements
4. Implement testing framework for new features

## Notes:
- All changes should maintain RTL support
- Keep performance in mind when adding new features
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Keep code modular and reusable
