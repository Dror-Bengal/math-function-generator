**importent**

Please follow these guidelines when updating files:

**General Instructions:**

- Preserve Existing Functionality: Ensure all updates maintain the current functionality of the code.
- No Code Removal Without Permission: Avoid removing any part of the code unless you have explicit permission from me.
- Fix and Improve: Focus on enhancing the code while ensuring existing features remain intact.
- Avoid Duplication: Keep the code clean and efficient by removing unnecessary duplication.
- Do Not Add New Files: Make all updates directly within the provided files.

**Additional Requirements:**

- Print Only Relevant Code: When providing code updates, print only the necessary and relevant sections instead of the entire file. This minimizes errors and simplifies the review process.
- Coordinate Multi-File Changes: If a change affects multiple files, clearly specify what needs to be updated next and explain how these changes are connected.
